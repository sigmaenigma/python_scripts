# Timer Script

This Python script implements a simple countdown timer. The timer counts down from a specified number of seconds and prints the remaining time in the format `MM:SS` to the console.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x

## Usage

1. **Set the countdown time**: Modify the `countdown_time` variable to the desired number of seconds for the countdown.

    ```python
    countdown_time = 10  # Set the countdown time in seconds
    ```

2. **Run the script**: Execute the script using Python.

    ```sh
    python timer.py
    ```

## Code Explanation

- The script imports the `time` module to use the `sleep` function.
- The `countdown_time` variable is set to the number of seconds for the countdown.
- A `while` loop runs as long as `countdown_time` is greater than zero.
- Inside the loop:
  - The `divmod` function is used to convert the total seconds into minutes and seconds.
  - The `timer` variable formats the minutes and seconds into `MM:SS`.
  - The remaining time is printed to the console with a carriage return (`\r`) to overwrite the previous output.
  - The script sleeps for one second.
  - The `countdown_time` is decremented by one.

## Example

If you set `countdown_time` to 10 seconds, the output will look like this:

```
Commence Countdown...00:10
Commence Countdown...00:09
Commence Countdown...00:08
...
Commence Countdown...00:01
Commence Countdown...00:00
```

## Notes

- Ensure you have Python 3.x installed on your system.
- You can adjust the `countdown_time` variable to any number of seconds you need.
